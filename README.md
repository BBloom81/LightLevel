# LightLevel

LightLevel adds a toggleable (default: `F9`) overlay that displays information about the the light level reaching blocks with a solid top in a 16-block radius. LightLevel has two modes.

## Normal mode

Normal mode displays the the block light level reaching the block. The color represents the possibility of hostile mobs spawning there:

* White: A mob cannot spawn.
* Yellow: A mob can spawn during the night.
* Red: A mob can always spawn.

LightLevel makes no attempt to determine if any condition other than light level is met for the block to be suitable for spawning mobs.

## Extended mode

Extended mode shares the same color scheme as Normal mode, however, the information it displays is different. Each block displays two numbers, the block light (denoted by the square symbol), and the sky light (denoted by the sun symbol).

Extended mode is active when the debug overlay (`F3`) is shown.
